# PoSnakeGame Implementation Steps

## High-Level Steps

1. **Set up Project Structure and Azure Development Environment**
   - [x] Create .gitignore file
   - [x] Set up AZURE TABLE STORAGE for  Azure storage 
   - [x] Ensure all projects build correctly
   - [x] Make sure azure table storage connection points to Azure table storage in the cloud
   - [x] Set up local logging

2. **Core Game Logic Implementation**
   - [x] Implement Snake model and movement logic
   - [x] Implement Arena and collision detection
   - [x] Implement PowerUp generation and effects
   - [x] Write unit tests for game logic

3. **AI Snake Behavior Implementation**
   - [ ] Implement CpuSnakeAI service 
   - [ ] Create different AI personality types
   - [ ] Implement pathfinding algorithms
   - [ ] Write unit tests for AI behavior

4. **Game Engine and Game Service Development**
   - [ ] Implement GameEngine for game state management
   - [ ] Implement GameService for coordinating game components
   - [ ] Create timer and scoring mechanisms
   - [ ] Write unit tests for game engine

5. **User Preferences and Configuration**
   - [ ] Implement UserPreferences model
   - [ ] Create storage service for user preferences
   - [ ] Add user customization options
   - [ ] Write unit tests for preferences system

6. **Blazor WebAssembly UI Development**
   - [ ] Create responsive game board UI
   - [ ] Implement keyboard and touch controls
   - [ ] Add game status and score display
   - [ ] Create main menu and settings screens

7. **High Score System & Backend API Implementation**
   - [ ] Implement HighScore model and storage
   - [ ] Create Azure Functions for score submission and retrieval (Original approach)
   - [x] Create ASP.NET Core Web API project (`PoSnakeGame.Api`) to duplicate/replace Function App logic (New approach)
   - [x] Connect Blazor UI (`PoSnakeGame.Wa`) to use the new Web API instead of Functions/direct service calls
   - [ ] Build high score display UI (UI exists, but now uses API service)
   - [ ] Write unit tests for high score system/API endpoints

8. **Azure Storage Integration**
   - [ ] Implement Azure Table Storage services 
   - [ ] Create data access services
   - [ ] Add error handling and retry logic
   - [ ] Write integration tests for Azure storage

9. **Finalize UI and UX**
   - [ ] Add visual effects and animations
   - [ ] Implement sound effects
   - [ ] Create responsive design for mobile
   - [ ] Conduct usability testing

10. **Deployment and CI/CD**
    - [x] Set up GitHub CI/CD Workflows (`ci.yml`, `posnakegame-staticwebapp.yml`, `deploy-api.yml`)
    - [x] Create Azure resources via CLI (App Service Plan `PoSnakeGameApiPlanWest2`, App Service `posnakegame-api`)
    - [ ] Configure Azure resources (Static Web App API linking in portal, GitHub Secret `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`)
    - [ ] Create Azure deployment scripts (if needed beyond workflows)
    - [ ] Implement Application Insights monitoring
    - [ ] Complete final testing and deployment

## Current Progress
We are currently at Step 1: Setting up the project structure and Azure development environment. We have set up Azurite for local Azure Storage emulation.
